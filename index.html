            <h2>Novel</h2>
            <p>Like ink spilling across parchment, the novel first unfurled in 2017, woven by the hand of Mo Xiang Tong Xiu. It was a tale carved in longing—a story of a fallen god, wandering with only tattered robes and a smile too soft for the heavens. A ghost king, cloaked in red, watched from the shadows, waiting for eternity to align their stars. It was here, in pages steeped with sorrow and devotion, that the legend began.</p>

            <p>Then came the manhua, illustrated by STARember, where lines and colors danced together, bringing faces to the names whispered between readers. Xie Lian’s warmth, Hua Cheng’s unwavering gaze—each stroke carried emotion, each scene a frozen moment of fate. The panels told the story anew, letting eyes see what hearts had always known.</p>

            <p>When the animated adaptation arrived, it did not walk—it soared. Wind and fire, battle and quiet longing, all unfolded with a rhythm that only motion could grant. The red butterfly fluttered through silver rain, vows were spoken in hushed tones beneath lantern light, and in the depths of ruin, a god’s hand met the fingers of his faithful ghost. Here, the story was no longer simply told; it lived.</p>

Laughter, anguish, devotion—the echoes of Xie Lian’s kindness and Hua Cheng’s quiet devotion rang clear, as if spoken by the heavens themselves.</p>
